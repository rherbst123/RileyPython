#  10. Golf Scores
#  The Springfork Amateur Golf Club has a tournament every weekend. The club president 
# has asked you to write two programs:
#  1. A program that will read each player’s name and golf score as keyboard input, then 
# save these as records in a file named golf.txt. (Each record will have a field for the 
# player’s name and a field for the player’s score.)
#  2. A program that reads the records from the golf.txt file and displays them.

golf_sheet = open("Chapter6/golf.txt", "r")
print("Here are the results from the game!")
